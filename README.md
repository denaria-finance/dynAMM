# dynAMM

Denaria is a **perpetual DEX** that lets anyone trade leading digital assets with up to 15× leverage. Every order is executed and settled onchain; no order books, no intermediaries, and no hidden risks.

Denaria has developed an innovative virtual AMM called **dynAMM**, which offers three key advantages over previous vAMM solutions used in the perpetuals sector:

* **Anchors** every trade to the **live oracle price,** so traders always enter at the true market price.
* **Regenerates** its curve after each transaction, repositioning liquidity around the new pool balances.
* **Adjusts** slippage automatically, keeping it low when system liquidity is abundant and raising it when liquidity is scarce.
